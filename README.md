# MP-Meta-Analysis
This is the data and code used for the Market Power Metha Analysis (I'll add link for the paper as soon as it is published)

If you want to run the code on your own - execute the files with .rmd extention in RStudio.
If you want just to check the analysis without installing and running anything, you can open files with .md extention in you browser.

I have tried to doublecheck everythinkg to avoid any errors. However I cannot garantee that my code is error/bug free. 
If you found any flaw or you have a suggestion - please contact me.
